# Python Shellshock

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates shellcode injection into a running process using the Windows API. This technique is often used in ethical hacking and penetration testing to understand vulnerabilities and develop stronger defenses.

## Features

- Opens a target process with specified permissions
- Allocates memory in the target process for shellcode
- Writes shellcode to the allocated memory
- Changes memory protection to allow execution of the shellcode
- Creates a remote thread in the target process to execute the shellcode
- Includes basic error handling

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `inject_shellcode.py`.
3. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges.
4. Run the script using:

    ```sh
    python inject_shellcode.py
    ```

## Example Shellcode

The script includes an example shellcode (a NOP sled). Replace this with your actual shellcode.

```python
shellcode = b"\x90\x90\x90\x90"  # Example NOP sled
```

## Example Process ID

Replace the placeholder process ID with the actual target process ID.

```python
process_id = 1234  # Replace with the target process ID
```

## Important Considerations

- Permissions: Running this script requires administrative privileges on the system.
- Ethical Use: Ensure that any use of this code complies with legal and ethical guidelines. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.
